With L = level, d = depth, h = heightâ€¦

a perfect binary tree has 2^0+...+2^d nodes
at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^d nodes
height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is d


QCC:
* N/A

DISCO:
* level is # of nodes from gvn node and root
* Depth is # of nodes b/t gvn nodes and root
* height is # of levels below gvn node
