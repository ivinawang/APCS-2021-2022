time spent: -

ACTIVITY 2
1) A deck is an object that allows you to access many instances of a card
2) This deck would contain 6 cards.
3)
* ranks would contain: Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace
* suits would contain: Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts, Spades
* pointValues contain: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11
4) Only the order of the ranks and pointValues matter because they correspond to each other. A deck will automatically create a card with each suit along with every rank.

ACTIVITY 3
1)
public static String flip() {
  int choice = (int)(Math.random()*3);
  if (choice <3) { // <3
    return "heads";
  }
  return "tails";
}

2)
public static boolean isIn(int[] arr, int value) {
  for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] = value) return true;
  }
  return false;
}
public static boolean arePermutations(int[] a, int[] b) {
  if (a.length != b.length) return false;
  for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    if(!isIn(a), b[i]) return false;
  }
  return true;
}

3) 4,3

ACTIVITY 6
1)
*5S + 6C
*5C + 6C
2) Yes, because JQK must be removed in sets of three, and the deck would otherwise always be even, so the only odd combination of leftover cards must contain a J,Q,K.
3) Yes, it involves a bit of strategy. It's preferable to remove duplicate cards (e.g. 2S, 2H) to maximize the chances of having a valid combination on the board.

ACTIVITY 7
1) Just a deck of cards. Instance variables:
* A Deck object
* An array that can hold 9 Card objects

2)
* Shuffle the deck.
* Initialize starting board by dealing 9 cards from the deck.
* Select and replace cards.
* Check if there are any legal moves. If not, game ends.
* If board is empty, game is won.

3) Yes

4)
  a. In the constructor and newGame() method.
  b. In the methods isLegal(), anotherPlayIsPossible().
  c. 0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 6, 4: 7
  d.
  public static void printCards(ElevensBoard board) {
    List<Integer> cIndexes = board.cardIndexes();
    for (int i : cIndexes) {
      System.out.println(board.cardAt[i]);
    }
  }
  e. anotherPlayIsPossible() needs to call cardIndexes to get the new deck that has been dealt.

  ACTIVITY 8
  1) They are all: solitaire games; use a board with a spread of cards; named after numbers; they all have legal conditions;
     They are different in that: they have different board sizes; they have different legal conditions; they have different names;
  2) An object of type Board is initialized, but is set to the constructor of ElevensBoard, which initializes the instance variables to be specific to Elevens.
  3) They do cover all the differences, as the major difference between the different solitaire games is their legal conditions; board size is taken care of in the constructor.

  ACTIVITY 9
